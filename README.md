MarsMission - Space Exploration Simulation
Overview
MarsMission is a simple Java-based space exploration simulation. In this app, students can simulate the process of launching a rocket, traveling through space, and landing on Mars. The app demonstrates the use of assertions in Java to validate key assumptions during the space mission, and it also incorporates time delays to simulate the journeyâ€™s progress.

Features
Rocket Launch: Launch the rocket with a specified amount of fuel.
Space Travel: Travel a given distance using the provided fuel.
Mars Landing: Safely land on Mars after traveling through space.
Assertions: The simulation uses assertions to validate fuel levels, travel distance, and landing conditions.
Time Delays: Time delays are added to simulate real-time mission phases.
